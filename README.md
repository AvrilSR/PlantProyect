# PlantProyect
Automated irrigation system where the humidity of a plant is measured to analyze if it should be watered or not with Arduino Uno
## Proces
<p>
  You'll need a FC-28 humidity sensor : 
  The FC-28 hygrometer is a very simple sensor that measures the humidity of the earth indirectly by calculating the conductivity   of the earth. If it can conduct electricity, it means that the earth is humid since water is a great conductor.
